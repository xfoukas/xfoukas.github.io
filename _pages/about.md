I am a Principal Researcher at [Microsoft Azure for Operators](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/industries/telecommunications/). Prior to this, I was a Senior Researcher at [Microsoft Research Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/) and a Research Associate in the [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) working in the research group of [Dr. Mahesh K. Marina](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mmarina/index.html). I received my PhD in Computer Science in 2018 from the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of Dr. Mahesh K. Marina and my MSc in Advanced Computing in 2013 from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). 

My research broadly falls under the domain of networks and distributed systems and in particular in the intersection of wireless and mobile networks and edge computing. My on-going research is on the following topics, focusing mostly on aspects relevant to next-generation mobile networks:

* vRAN architecture & performance
* Programmable edge architectures for real-time observability and control
* Applications of machine learning to mobile networks
* Large-scale testbeds and experimentation
